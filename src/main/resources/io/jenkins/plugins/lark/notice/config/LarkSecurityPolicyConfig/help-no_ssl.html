    <p>Disable SSL/TLS certificate verification in the Java HTTP client. </p>
    <p><strong>⚠️ Note: </strong>Disabling certificate verification reduces the security of the connection and may lead
        to security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. It is recommended to use this option only in a controlled
        test environment and make sure you understand the associated risks. </p>
